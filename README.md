**University Institute HTML Theme** as the name suggests is an HTML template for Colleges, Schools, Universities, E.T.C. 

The main goal of this theme is to deliver information like notices and other updates to students with ease. Providing a better user experience to the students. Its focus on recurring visitors rather than one-time visitors and hence is suitable for internal Department websites.

There will be a HUGO build of this theme. This repository is to make opensource contribution easy for people who understand frontend technologies like HTML & CSS but don't want to struggle with HUGO file structures and GO Templates.
